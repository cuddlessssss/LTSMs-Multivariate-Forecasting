# Error1: test_size=1 should be either positive and smaller than the number of samples 1 or a float in the (0, 1) range.

# Cause: The error occurs when you specify test_size=1 for train_test_split, but the total number
# of samples (the length of X) is too small. test_size=1 means you want 100% of your data to 
# go into the test set, but you can't take more than 100% of your data.
# You can either provide a float between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.2 for 20% test data), or specify an 
# integer smaller than the number of samples.

# Fix: The test_size should be a float (e.g., 0.2 for 20% test data), or you should make sure 
# that your dataset has enough samples to accommodate the size you want for the test set.

# -----------------------------------

# Error2: With n_samples=1, test_size=0.3 and train_size=None, the resulting train set will be empty.

# Cause: This error occurs when you specify test_size=0.3 but your dataset has only one sample 
# (or fewer samples than required for the specified test/train split). Since the split is trying 
# to allocate 30% of one sample to the test set, it leaves nothing for the training set, resulting 
# in an empty training set.

# train_test_split cannot create a valid split with fewer than 2 samples when a portion is reserved 
# for both training and testing.

# Fix: To resolve this, ensure that your dataset contains enough samples for the split you desire. 
# A fallback option could be to either:
# - Increase the size of your dataset.
# - Use a lower test_size (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2).
# - Skip the split and use the entire dataset for training if there's only one sample.
